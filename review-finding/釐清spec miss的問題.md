Frontend review finding:

Category field is a dropdown (select), but no option source is defined in API or UI spec.

Could you confirm the source of Category options?

* Is it a fixed enum from backend?
* Or a separate reference API?
* Or should it be derived from existing data?

Impact:
Category dropdown cannot be implemented without a defined option list.
